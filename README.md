### Jumbotron Layout

If you are using a layout that contains `jumbotron` then you can choose to display an image carousel header, standard background image header or a simple breadcrumb.

**Jumbotron Settings**

With the jumbotron layouts you can add a title, sub title and buttons to your header through changing your pages' front matter. 

The jumbotron `title` can be modified by changing the title value in the page front matter:

```yaml
---
title: Your Page Title (and jumbotron title)
...
---
```

The jumbotron `sub title`/`description` can be modified by changing the description value in the page front matter:

```yaml
---
...
description: >-
    Your Page description (and jumbotron description/sub title)
...
---
```

The jumbotron `buttons` can be added with the following front matter:

```yaml
---
...
jumbotron:
    ...
    buttons:
        - title: Learn More
          url: /about/
          icon: fa fa-github
          ...
...
---
```
The above should hopefully be fairly self explanatory other than the icon value which should be the icon class for a Font Awesome 4.7 Icon. For all available icons [click here](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/). 


**Displaying an image carousel**

If you would like to display an image carousel for your page then add the following front matter to your page:

```yaml
---
...
jumbotron:
    ...
    carousel-images:
        - /assets/images/content/background-image1.jpg
        - /assets/images/content/background-image2.png
        - /assets/images/content/background-image3.jpg
    ...
...
---
```
Add as many images here as you would like. Even though these images are loaded lazily, try and make sure the images have been optimized as large images will increase the page load time. Also try to ensure the resolution of these images are fairly high.


**Displaying an background image based jumbotron**

```yaml
---
...
jumbotron:
    ...
    background-image: /assets/images/content/background-image1.jpg
    ...
...
---
```
Here you can add image to be used an the background image of the jumbotron. Try and make sure the image has been compressed/optimized as large images will increase the page load time. Also try to ensure the resolution of these images are fairly high.




# Adding Content
## Adding Pages

### Step 1 - Setup your site if not already setup

__Note: If you're reading these docs for a site that's already using the theme then you can skip this part.__

The first step when using this theme is to create your own Jekyll site based off of this theme.

### Step 2 - Create a new page file

Website pages are added as markdown files usually in a folder with a `README.md` file beneath to keep everything organised and to ensure content renders on GitHub too (e.g `/services/README.md` or `/services.md`). If your page mainly contains HTML then use the `.html` file extension.

### Step 2 - Add Jekyll front matter to your new page

The url/permalink for your page should be added to the `front matter` of your posts/pages (the section at the top of the file between the set of 3 dashes `---`) as the `permalink` so that your page url is exactly as you intended it to be. See below for an example of the front matter to add to your page. 

Each theme layout may have different front matter variables that are required so if in any doubt refer to the [layouts](#available-layouts) section of this documentation.. 

#### Available front matter options

Below is a table of the most common front matter variable to add to your page.

| Front Matter Option | Value | Description  | 
| ------ | ----------- | ----- |
| layout | post | Layout to be used for the page (use `default` if you're unsure) |
| keywords | hikey970, Arm, Linaro, Open Source | Used for the meta keywords tag by jekyll-seo-tag plugin |
| published | false | Set `published` to false if you want to add the page but not show it on the website. |
| title | My Awesome Post | The title of your page/post. Used in the `meta` tags and in layouts to display your page correctly. |
| description | This is an awesome post about your site... | The description of your page used as the `meta` description.|

#### Example front matter

```YAML
---
# Layout of your web page - see below for available layouts.
layout: jumbotron-container
# URL of your page
permalink: /about/
# Title of your page
title: About Us
# Description of your web page.
desc: |-
    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy 
    text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
    survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was 
    popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
    publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
# Keywords that describe your page used as meta keywords.
tags: lorem, ipsum, web, page
jumbotron:
    carousel-images:
        - /assets/images/content/background-image1.jpg
        - /assets/images/content/background-image2.png
        - /assets/images/content/background-image3.jpg
---
Markdown content goes here.
```

### Step 2 - Add content to your page

Now you can add content to your page using `html` of `markdown`. You can find a markdown cheatsheet [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). 

## Adding Posts

In order to add a blog post to your site copy an existing post from the _posts folder if one exists otherwise create a new _posts folder. Posts are best organised by year/month so add to the correct folder based on the month you are posting it in and if the folder doesn't exist create one.

#### Step 1 - Modify the post file name

The url for your title is based on the title provided in the filename e.g 2018-06-07-i2s-in-dragonboard410c.md will have a url of /blog/i2s-in-dragonboard410c/. Separate the words in your title by dashes and modify the date at the start of the filename as neccessary. 

#### Step 2 - Modify the post front matter

Modify the post front matter based on your post. Values to modify are:
- author:
- date:
- image:
- tags:
- description:

##### Author

Change the author to a unique author shortname. If this is your first time posting then add your author values to the _authors Jekyll collection (see this [collection](https://github.com/Linaro/website/tree/master/_authors) for an example). Make sure to add a profile image to the [/assets/images/authors folder](https://github.com/96boards/website/tree/master/assets/images/authors) and then refernce in authors page in the _authors collection. Verify that the author username is an exact match to that provided as the author: in your post.

##### Date

Modify the date of your post to a valid time before you post the blog otherwise Jekyll will see it as a __future__ post and not render it until the time on the server exceeds/equals that provided as the date in the post front matter.

##### Image

This value is used for the featured image displayed on your blog post and the image that is used when sharing the blog post on social media sites.

```YAML
image:
    featured: true
    path: /assets/images/blog/DragonBoard-UpdatedImages-front.png
    name: DragonBoard-UpdatedImages-front.png
```
Thumbnails are generated on site build by the jekyll-responsive-image plugin (so make sure that the image you provide is of a relatively high resolution).

Make sure that the image you add in this section of front matter is placed in the [/assets/images/blog folder](https://github.com/96boards/website/tree/master/assets/images/blog).

__Note:__ There is currently a bug with the version of `jekyll-assets` we are using which means the only acceptable image extensions are `.jpg` and `.png`. If you use `.jpeg` you image may not display as expected.


##### Tags
These should be modified based on the content of your post as they are used for Meta keywords so that people can find your post based on the [tags your provide](https://www.your site/blog/tag/).

##### Description
Change this value to a short description of your blog post as this is used for the meta description of your blog post.

#### Step 3 - Add your post content.

Write your post content in Markdown format; specifically the [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) Markdown flavour.

##### Adding images
Please use the following code snipppet to add an image to your blog post. Make sure to add the images that you include to [/assets/images/blog folder](https://github.com/96boards/website/tree/master/assets/images/blog).

```
{% include image.html name="name-of-your-image.png" alt="The Alt text for your image" %}
```

You also align/scale your image using the following css classes.

|Class|Details|
|-----|-------|
|small-inline|Small image aligned to the left|
|small-inline right| Small image aligned to the right|
|medium-inline|Medium image aligned to the left|
|medium-inline right|Medium image aligned to the right|
|large-inline|Large image aligned to the left|
|large-inline right|Large image aligned to the right|

```
{% include image.html name="name-of-your-image.png"  class="medium-inline" alt="The Alt text for your image" %}
```

Using this Jekyll include will allow your images to be lazy loaded and format the image HTML correctly.


##### Adding code

We are using the rouge syntax highlighter to highlight your glorious code. 

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --port 1337
```

See the full list of languages [here](https://github.com/jneen/rouge/wiki/List-of-supported-languages-and-lexers).


##### Adding Media/YouTube videos

To add a media element / YouTube video use the following Jekyll include.

```
{% include media.html media_url="https://youtu.be/GFzJd0hXI0c" %}
```

# Adding Redirects

__Note__: This section is only applicable to static sites deployed within Linaro. You can however use the same approach for your site using the following method.

We are using [Edge-rewrite](https://github.com/marksteele/edge-rewrite) which is a rewrite engine running in Lambda@Edge. The redirects are to be added to the `_data/routingrules.json` file in the webiste repository following the syntax rules [here](https://github.com/marksteele/edge-rewrite).

```
^/oldpath/(\\d*)/(.*)$ /newpath/$2/$1 [L]
!^/oldpath.*$ http://www.example.com [R=302,L,NC]
^/topsecret.*$ [F,L]
^/deadlink.*$ [G]
^/foo$ /bar [H=^baz\.com$]
```

__Note:__ These redirects are currently not respected by the link checker until built. So if trying to fix broken links by adding redirects then this may not be the best way to go about it currently. 

# Building your static site

We are working towards creating a Dockerfile for building Linaro's static sites (if familiar with Docker you can find many [Jekyll based Docker images])(https://hub.docker.com/r/jekyll/jekyll/) to get started). In the mean time you can still clone the site and install bundler/jekyll gems and ruby to build the site locally.

In order to build the 96Boards.org static site make sure you have Ruby and the bundler/jekyll gems installed. For instructions on how to setup an environment to build Jekyll sites see the official Jekyll documentation [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

Once you have above installed you can simply clone this repo and the [96Boards Documentation Repo](https://github.com/96boards/documentation). You will then need to modify the [build.sh](https://github.com/96boards/website/blob/master/build.sh) file to pull the documentation into your website repo before building the static site. Amend the top two lines of the build.sh file so that the correct paths are used. Then run the script to move the documentation files over to the _documentation collection in the website repo.

```
$ ./build.sh
```

After you have moved the documentation files over you can go ahead and run the following to get the site building:

```
$ bundle 
```

This will install the required gems listed in the Gemfile.

```
$ bundle exec jekyll s 
```

This will serve (s) the Jekyll static website to the http://localhost:4000 where you can view the generated static website.
